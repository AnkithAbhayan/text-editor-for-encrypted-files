# text-editor-for-encrypted-files
This is a text editor to save and edit encrypted files of the extension .ankiecrypt (new file type made by me!)  
So this text editor will let you open and close and edit encrypted files (encrypted by my encryption algorithm) of the extension - .ankiecrypt.  
this is fairly easy to use just like any other normal text editor.   
repository will include a cache.json file for saving file paths (dont delete it tho)  
a requirements.txt file for the requirements (no 3rd party libraries needed)(more info in the requirements.txt file)  
and also ankith.py which contains my encryption algorithm.  
run - texteditor.py and not ankith.py
enjoy!

latest version - v1.2.    
prompts for password everytime before opening.(tkinter ui)  
ability to change password and reset password in the menubar(prompts for current password before changing/resetting password.)  
deleted unnecessary functions in ankith.py.  

spoliers for version - v1.3!   
title of the editor window will contain the file-size and current time.
