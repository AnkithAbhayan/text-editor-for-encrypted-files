# text-editor-for-encrypted-files
This is a text editor to save and edit encrypted files of the extension .ankiecrypt (new file type made by me!)  
So this text editor will let you open and close and edit encrypted files (encrypted by my encryption algorithm) of the extension - .ankiecrypt.  
this is fairly easy to use just like any other normal text editor.   
run - texteditor.py and not ankith.py  
enjoy!  

installation steps:
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/AnkithAbhayan/text-editor-for-encrypted-files" "ankith's text editor"
cd "ankith's text editor"
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd "ankith's text editor\version - 1.3"
python texteditor.py
```

latest version - v1.3(still working on it!).    
title of the editor window will contain the file-size.
added an 'exit' button in the file menu of the menubar to stop runnng.
previously opened files can be accessed through the menubar as well.
